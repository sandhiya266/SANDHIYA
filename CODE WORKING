How the Code Works?
The game is divided into rounds, with a maximum of MAX_ROUNDS rounds.
In each round, a random number is generated between MIN_NUMBER and MAX_NUMBER.
The user is prompted to guess the number, and their guess is compared to the generated number.
If the guess is too low or too high, the user is given feedback and allowed to try again.
If the user guesses the number correctly, they score a point and the round ends.
If the user uses up all their attempts without guessing the number, the round ends and the next round begins.
After all rounds have been played, the user's final score is displayed.
