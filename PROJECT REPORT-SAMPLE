Project Report: Number Guessing Game in Java

Project Overview
The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based game written in Java. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number within a specified number of attempts. The game is divided into rounds, and the user's score is based on the number of rounds won.

Project Objectives
The objectives of this project were:

To create a simple console-based game in Java.
To implement a number guessing game with a limited number of attempts.
To add the option for multiple rounds and display the user's score.
To provide feedback to the user on their guesses.
Project Design and Implementation
The game is designed using a simple and intuitive approach. The game is divided into rounds, and each round consists of the following steps:

Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
Prompt the user to guess the number.
Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number or uses up all their attempts.
The game is implemented using Java, and the code is organized into two main methods: main and playRound. The main method controls the game flow, and the playRound method implements the game logic for each round.

Project Features
The game has the following features:

Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 for each round.
Limited Attempts: The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
Multiple Rounds: The game allows the user to play multiple rounds, and the user's score is displayed at the end of each round.
Feedback: The game provides feedback to the user on their guesses, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low.
Project Testing and Debugging
The game was tested thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. The testing process involved:

Unit Testing: Each method was tested individually to ensure that it works correctly.
Integration Testing: The game was tested as a whole to ensure that all the methods work together correctly.
Debugging: Any errors or bugs found during testing were fixed and re-tested.
Project Conclusion
The Number Guessing Game in Java is a simple and fun console-based game that meets all the project objectives. The game is well-designed, implemented, and tested, and it provides a good user experience. The game can be further improved by adding more features, such as different difficulty levels or a graphical user interface.

Recommendations for Future Improvements
Add Different Difficulty Levels: The game can be improved by adding different difficulty levels, such as easy, medium, and hard.
Implement a Graphical User Interface: The game can be improved by implementing a graphical user interface, such as a GUI or a web-based interface.
Add More Features: The game can be improved by adding more features, such as a high score table or a multiplayer option.
